* REQUEST: client visits /bookmarks (get request) (client --> controller/server)
* controller (app.rb) asks Bookmark class (model) to retrieve bookmarks (#print_list) (server --> model)
* the Bookmark class returns all stored bookmarks as array (model --> controller/server)
* controller renders the [bookmarks] array to webpage (HTML) view (controller --> view --> controller)
* RESPONSE: This view is sent to the user as a response (controller --> client)
